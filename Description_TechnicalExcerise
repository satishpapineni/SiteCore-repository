Hi
I created NUnit Framework Application instead of Console Application. So, It could not work with F5 . Please run the application on TestUnit1 with Right click.
Please Once go through Application, I build the code with desired output.
I did Technical Excerise within Conditions
I Used C# to get Desired OutCome.
And also used Selenium WebDriver(the driver execute .exe automatically, no need to give the path )// we can give chrome or edge browser in app settings.
Test completed within 30 sec 
I Find the WebElements with PageFactory,pageobjectmodel and imported the related packages.
I pick the href attributes and Iterate the loop and click the first iteration.
I pick the price element and I did conversions to get from string to var.
For Every step I did Validations.
Thank You.
